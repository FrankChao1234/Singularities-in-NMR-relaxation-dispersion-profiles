# This is the script allowing the back-calculation of the differences between R2,eff at two vCPMG frequencies through fitting the HARD data.
# The library for the data fitting of HARD is too large to be included here.
# In this example, the HARD data were acquired at 800MHz from methyl groups in Ube2g2. The differences between two theoretical R2,eff values were calculated between vCPMG frequencies of 50Hz and 1000Hz.
